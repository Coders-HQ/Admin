<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Coders Headquarters (CodersHQ) is a social platform for developers to grow, network, challenge themselves, and gain points by contributing and helping others in this community. This platform was built by the community and for the community. The essence of CodersHq is to inspire everyone to learn to code, share knowledge and learn together. <br/>

The CodersHQ Interface project aims to build a Web-User Interface to work with the backend of the project. This will be used to perform various tasks.</p>

<h3 id="adminpage">:man_technologist: Admin Page</h3>
<p>The Admin Page is a web interface that is designed to manage the entire CodersHQ Ecosystem. For now, this includes user management, event management and CodersHQ Bounties. Here are some of the functionalities that the Admin Page will offer:
  <ol>
    <li>Logging in</li>
    <li>Look at the users</li>
    <li>Filter Users</li>
    <li>Edit Events</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Create Events</li>
        <li>Modify Events</li>
        <li>Delete Events</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Add/Remove items</li>
    <li>Overall dashboard of activity</li>
  </ol>
To inspire, below will be attached a design which can be used only for inspirational purposes. Nothing in the design depicts the final product and everything has to be considered from scratch. We expect you to release all the creativity inside you in coming up with a beautiful and modern interface for the Admin Page.

        <li>This design is not to be taken as a Design Specification.</li>
        <li>The interface team is not responsible for any backend code.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that none of this is set in stone. We're all ears for any suggestions you may have üëÇüèª</li>
